      "Flows is a series of four media compositions produced between 2020-2021. The series is a combined work of electronic music production and graphics programming, composed entirely with software as a reflection on data as material and medium. The work follows research into an expansive field of digital sculpture within which visual and sonic elements are combined and developed as oppositions throughout practice. Through working with low-level visual and audio programming tools, contingency is developed as a theme throughout the work as part of a ‘limited aleatoric counterpoint’. The varied audio sources represents an archival approach to re-sampling salvaged material from hard-drives which is then processed using a breadth of DSP techniques in an electroacoustic language inspired by the Hyperrealism of Noah Creshevsky. Visually, early pioneers of ‘visual music’ such as John Whitney and Oskar Fischinger are referenced alongside experimental film-makers such as Stan Brakhage. Length: 12 minutes 45 seconds. Visuals by Will Irving. Produced, Recorded by Will Irving. Mixed and Mastered by Al Carlson.",

      "Forms is a series of 8 short media compositions produced in 2020 as part of initial research into audiovisual relationships and digital sculpture. Each form was generated using the 3D modelling technique ‘volume ray marching’ and then short, experimental scores were produced improvisationally in response to each clip over the course of a week. Visually, this the first experiment with graphics programming in practice and takes influence from the early computer art demoscene. Sonically, an aim for the project was to create short audio motifs and partner them with forms such that when either the visual ‘sculputre’ or isolated piece of audio would be recalled, its counterpart would come to mind, a method of enquiry that has been since continued and developed in later work. Available on request. Visuals by Will Irving. Recorded, produced, mixed by Will Irving",
